Wordpress Woocommerce plugin to set an estimated delivery time for all products

== Description ==

Thanks for showing interest in this plugin. 

Failed to find a plugin that would simply show the delivery time on a product level (I only found date pickers on checkout, is not what i needed). I decided to write my own plugin. 

This plugin shows, in accordance with the schema.org deliveryLeadTime on every product page. The estimated delivery time can easily be changed in woocommerce - settings - integration. 

This is the first version of the plugin, future updates might include estimated delivery per product and on stock level.
You can contribute on github via https://github.com/chinib/Woocommerce-Delivery-Time

Have fun.

1. Via Wordpress - Plugins - Add New search for Woocommerce Delivery Time or manually Upload `wc-delivery-time.zip` 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the settings via woocommerce - settings - integration
